### Hi there 👋, my name is Md Golam Rabbani
#### I am a Mechatronics Engineering Student.

I’m a Mechatronics Engineering student with a strong interest in robotics, automation and intelligent systems. My academic background combines mechanical, electrical and computer engineering ---allowing me to design and develop efficient electromechanical systems.

I’m currently enhancing my programming skills in C, C++, Python and MATLAB and I enjoy working with Arduino, sensors and control systems. Alongside my studies, I serve as the Vice President of my university’s Mechatronics Club, where I collaborate with peers on innovative projects and workshops.

My goal is to pursue an MSc in Mechatronics or Robotics in Germany, to further develop advanced automation skills and contribute to cutting-edge engineering solutions.

Skills: Mechatronics Engineer | Business Operation | Python Expert | Computer Software & Hardware Experts.
